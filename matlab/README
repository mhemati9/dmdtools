README for a Streaming Dynamic Mode Decomposition (SDMD)
========================================================

The Matlab scripts contained in this distribution contain:  (1) a Matlab class for an 
object-oriented impelentation of incrementally updated DMD, and (2) an example
to demonstrate the use of this class on an arbitrary dynamical system.  These scripts
are supplementary materials associated with Hemati et al. (2014).


SDMD Distribution Contents
==========================

StreamingDMD.m
--------------
A Matlab class that implements SDMD in an object-oriented fashion, 
based on the formulation in Hemati et al. (2014).

sdmd_run.m
----------
Demonstrates usage of the StreamingDMD class in solving an arbitrary
dynamical system with two characteristic frequencies.


Note: use the `help' and `doc' commands within Matlab to access more detailed
descriptions of these scripts.
